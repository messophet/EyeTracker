# EyeTracker

This project leverages OpenCV (4) to detect faces and eyes in a continuous video stream. The UI and backend are written in QML and QT/C++, respectively.

Add 'install' to your Make steps in the build settings of QT Creator. This step installs the XML files required to perform the face/eye detection.

Enjoy!
